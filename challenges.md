# Some good recursive coding challenges

*the 3 basics of recursion - base case, general case, and proof that a base case will be reached. ...*  
*Depth first, breadth first, reverse order...*  
*guarded recursion*  

"*When you define a list as "any number of items where one comes after the other", you naturally think of iterative operations on lists -- you want to operate on that list with a "for" loop.

But when you define a list as "either empty, or an item followed by a list" then suddenly it becomes very natural to think recursively.  The operation on the list becomes "solve the empty case, or solve the one-item case and recurse on the tail.""*
