# Patterns

*Patterns are the recurring solutions to the problems of design.*

Patterns provide the elements of a language for thinking and talking about our work. Patterns can de used together to design a learning environment, a workplace, an organisation, a project, a product, or a piece of software. 

## Elements of a pattern

A Pattern consists of:

+ a ***Title***, that refers to the pattern; 
+ a ***picture*** that conveys the pattern; 
+ a ***context***, that explains where it sits in the heirarchy of patterns; 
+ a ***statement of the problem*** that the pattern attempts to address; 
+ a ***desciption of the pattern*** that refers to any patterns on which this pattern relies and any new information that this pattern introduces, and examples that demonstrate the pattern; 
+ a ***statement of the pattern*** that provides a solution to the problem; 
+ a list of ***Related patterns***; and 
+ a list of ***References***.
