# Redux

The three principles of Redux

1. There is a single source of truth. The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.
1. State is read-only. The only way to mutate the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
1. Changes are made with pure functions. To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.
