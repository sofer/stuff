# The transformation priority premise

Bob Martin's premise is that when doing the red-green-refactor approach to test-driven development, you will find yourself applying a series of simple transformations to your code to get each successive test to pass, and that you are less likely to get stuck or to have to do significant refactoring if you stick to the following priority order for your transformations, starting with those at the top and moving down the list one step at a time as you introduce each new test:

+ `({}â€“>nil)` no code at all->code that employs nil
+ `(nil->constant)`
+ `(constant->constant+)` a simple constant to a more complex constant
+ `(constant->scalar)` replacing a constant with a variable or an argument
+ `(statement->statements)` adding more unconditional statements.
+ `(unconditional->if)` splitting the execution path
+ `(scalar->array)`
+ `(array->container)`
+ `(statement->tail-recursion)`
+ `(if->while)`
+ `(statement->recursion)`
+ `(expression->function)` replacing an expression with a function or algorithm
+ `(variable->assignment)` replacing the value of a variable.
+ `(case)` adding a `case` (or `else`) to an existing `switch` or `if`

If you find yourself unable to follow this general priority order, then go back and look at your most recent test and see if you can replace it with a different test that will allow you to pass with a higher-priority transformation.
